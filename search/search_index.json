T_C_2.2 Registration Verify registration fails if the user attempts to register with an email that already exists in the system. An appropriate error message must be displayed (e.g., \u201cEmail already registered\u201d), and the user must remain on the registration page. No new record should be created. T_C_2.3 Registration Verify registration fails if the Name field is left empty. An error message indicating the field is required (e.g., \u201cName is mandatory\u201d) must be displayed. T_C_2.4 Registration Verify registration fails if the Email field is left empty. An error message indicating the field is required (e.g., \u201cEmail is required\u201d) must be displayed. T_C_2.5 Registration Verify registration fails if the Password field is left empty. An error message indicating the field is required (e.g., \u201cPassword is required\u201d) must be displayed. T_C_2.6 Registration Verify registration fails if the user provides an invalid email format (e.g., missing '@' or using spaces). A format validation error message (e.g., \u201cPlease enter a valid email address\u201d) must be displayed. T_C_2.7 Registration Verify registration fails if the Password does not meet complexity requirements (e.g., missing a special character or capital letter). A specific error message detailing the required password criteria must be displayed.
