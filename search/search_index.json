T_C_2.2 Registration Verify registration fails if the user attempts to register with an email that already exists in the system. An appropriate error message must be displayed (e.g., \u201cEmail already registered\u201d), and the user must remain on the registration page. No new record should be created.

A format validation error message (e.g., \u201cPlease enter a valid email address\u201d) must be displayed. T_C_2.7 Registration Verify registration fails if the Password does not meet complexity requirements (e.g., missing a special character or capital letter). A specific error message detailing the required password criteria must be displayed.
